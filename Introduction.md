## What is a network ?

A network is officially defined as a group or system of interconnected people or items.
There are two main purposes of computer networks:
 - Communication using computers
- Sharing of resources. 

An “internet” allows doing these two things across different computer networks. The Internet is essentially a network of computer networks.

> internet vs. Internet :  An internet with a lowercase “i” is any
interconnection of computer networks. Whereas the global Internet is
always spelled with a capital I.


## History Of Internet

1. ARPANET − Advanced Research Projects Agency Network : 1969 
 The first four nodes included : UCLA, Stanford, Santa Barbara and University of Utah.
	 * E-mail was created by Roy Tomlinson in 1972.
	 * TCP/IP was developed in 1970s and adopted by ARPANET in 1983.
	 
2. Telenet -  was the first commercial adaptation of ARPANET introduced in 1974.
 
3. World Wide Web was created in 1990 by Tim Berners Lee at CERN

4. 1990 : ARPANET got decommissioned, Web Browser Nexus was developed and HTML came to being. 

5. Web 2.0 was born in 2002.

## Internet Standards Document

An **Internet Standard** is a normative specification of a technology or methodology applicable to the Internet. Internet Standards are created and published by the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") (IETF).

### RFC
- An RFC or Request For Comments is a document that contains proposals for new protocols or systems. An RFC is deliberated on by experts, revised and then hopefully, eventually adopted as a standard.
- RFCs are generally written by those who work at IETF, Internet
researchers, and specialists. However, an RFC can be written by anyone!
For more details, click [here](https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/).
- All Internet protocols, like the world wide web, are described by one or more RFCs.
- RFCs were started by Steve Crocker to document details of ARPANET while it was being created.

### Contents of RFC
