## Access Networks
Access networks are networks that physically connect end systems to the first router on a
path which connects them to some other end systems.

### Access Networks vs Core Networks
An access network is a type of telecommunications network which connects subscribers to their immediate service provider. 
It is contrasted with the core network, which connects local providers to one another.

### Network Interface Adapter
The network interface adapter enables a computer to attach to a network.
These interfaces are essentially the physical gateways that connect devices to the Internet.

Wifi, DSL, Fiber-to-the-home, Dial up, Satellite etc are examples of Access Networks.

## Transmission Rates
The rate at which data is transmitted from one point to another in a network
is called the transmission rate.

The outgoing transmission rate is called the *upload rate*, and the incoming transmission rate is called the *download rate*.
Some networks have varying upload and download transmission rates, called
asymmetric transmission rates. This is useful because traffic going out from
end hosts generally consists of small requests which solicit comparatively
much larger responses.

## Types of Access Networks

### Digital Subscriber Line
A Digital Subscriber Line or DSL uses the existing groundwork of telephone
lines for an Internet connection.

#### Internet Service Provider
An ISP is just the company that provides end users with an Internet
connection.

#### How DSL works ?
- A device on the home user’s end called a DSL modem modulates the
digital signals that a computer outputs into high-frequency analog audio
signals that are out of the human voice and hearing range.

- These signals are then carried by telephone wires over to the ISP.

- Then, these high-frequency analog signals are converted back to digital
 signals using a device at the ISP’s end called a **Digital Subscriber Line
 Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)**.

- The signals are then forwarded to the end system that it was meant to
  reach

### Cable Internet
- In the case of cable Internet, the TV cable company is the ISP and it relies
  on the preexisting infrastructure of cable TV to grant Internet access.

- It runs on coaxial cable. Coaxial cable has enough of a frequency range to
  carry TV channels and a stream of upstream and downstream Internet.

- However, cable Internet can be slower during peak hours, when a majority of
  users are online at once. This is because cable Internet is a *shared broadcast
  medium* : every signal that comes from the ISP is sent to every single home
  regardless of which one it was meant for.

### Hybrid Fiber Coax
Cable internet working with coaxial cable and optic fiber.
The fiber connects optical nodes that exist in every neighborhood to the ISP and coaxial cable
further connects the nodes to the houses.

### Fiber To Home
Optic fiber cables are claimed to be the
cleanest method to transmit data.

### Dial-Up
Dial-Up uses a modem over the telephone line, but does not fully utilize the
spectrum of the transmission medium. It only uses the traditional voice
channel frequencies. Hence, it is slower than DSL.
Speed of 56kbps.

### Satellite
The Internet can also be accessed via satellites. This can be beneficial in
remote areas where other physical access networks are not available.
Average speed of 1mbps downstream and 256kbps upstream.
